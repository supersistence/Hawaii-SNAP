   - Validation script identifies and flags these
   - Affects mapping accuracy

2. **README Discrepancy:** County bi-annual data
   - README states "through January 2021"
   - Actual file ends July 2020
   - 5+ year update needed

3. **Data Currency:** All datasets are 3-5 years out of date (as of Oct 2025)

### Update Priority Recommendations

**CRITICAL (High Impact, Easy Update):**
1. ✅ Statewide Monthly Data → May 2025
2. ✅ SNAP Retailer Historical → Dec 31, 2024

**IMPORTANT (Verify Availability):**
3. ⚠️ County Bi-Annual → Check if still published
4. ⚠️ Application Data → Check Hawaii DHS releases

**OPTIONAL (Consider Source):**
