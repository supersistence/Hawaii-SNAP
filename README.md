# Compiling and Sharing SNAP Data for Hawaii

The USDA provides various data for download at https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap

### State Level Monthly Data 
FY69-FY22 data is shared as a .zip file containing numerous .xls files. 
The dataset covers *Persons, Households, Benefits, and Average Monthly Benefit per Person & Household*, however from 1969-1988 data are only availably at the national level. 

Thus, Hawaii data for FY89-FY22 within these files has been compiled and is now available as:
- a [CSV file](https://github.com/supersistence/Hawaii-SNAP/blob/main/Data/SNAP%20FY%2089-22.csv)
- a [data visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/SNAP_16192081784540/1988-2022MonthlySNAPData?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
