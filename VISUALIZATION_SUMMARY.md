## Key Visualizations & Insights

### Chart 1: Overview - Participation Over Time
**Type**: Dual-line time series
**Dimensions**: Households + Persons (1999-2022)
**Insights**:
- Clear upward trend from 2008 recession
- Gradual decline 2014-2019
- Massive COVID-19 spike in 2020-2021
- Post-pandemic decline visible

**Implications**:
- Program responds to economic crises
- Baseline ~50-60K households even during growth
- COVID spike (+66%) shows crisis capacity
- Recovery slower than initial shock

---

### Chart 2: Benefit Levels
**Type**: Line chart
**Dimension**: Average benefit per household over time
**Insights**:
- Steady ~$250/month pre-COVID
- Jump to $600-700 in 2021
- Peak $988 in August 2021 (emergency allotments)
- Decline to $734 by January 2022

**Implications**:
- Emergency benefits dramatically boosted purchasing power
- $988/month = major household budget impact
- Transition down from peak visible
- 2024-2026 further decreases will reduce to ~$600/month

---

### Chart 3: COVID-19 Impact Analysis
**Type**: Dual-axis line (households + benefits)
**Period**: 2019-2022
**Insights**:
- Pre-COVID average: 67,000 households
- Peak: 112,000 households (July 2021)
- Increase: +45,000 households (+66%)
- Benefit spike coincides with participation spike

**Implications**:
- Tourism shutdown immediately impacted service workers
- Program absorbed 45,000 additional households rapidly
- Emergency allotments provided enhanced support
- Economic indicator: sharp rise = crisis, decline = recovery

---

### Chart 4: County Distribution
**Type**: Grouped bar chart
**Dimension**: Persons + Households by county
**Insights**:
- Honolulu dominates (75K+ persons, 60% of total)
- Hawaii County: ~45K persons
- Maui: ~19K persons
- Kauai: ~9K persons

**Implications**:
- Urban concentration (Oahu)
- But rural counties have higher per-capita rates
- Geographic service delivery challenges
- Inter-island equity considerations

---

### Chart 5: Public Assistance vs Non-PA
**Type**: Stacked bar chart
**Dimension**: PA vs Non-PA by county
**Insights**:
- Non-PA participants vastly outnumber PA (70-80%)
- Pattern consistent across all counties
- Working poor are majority of recipients

**Implications**:
- SNAP serves working families, not just welfare recipients
- Wage insufficiency is primary driver
- Work requirements affect majority
- Economic development needed, not just assistance

---

### Chart 6: Total Program Costs
**Type**: Line chart
**Dimension**: Monthly total benefits over time
**Insights**:
- Pre-COVID: $30-40M monthly
- COVID peak: $111M monthly (August 2021)
- Latest: $68M monthly (January 2022)
- 3x increase from baseline to peak

**Implications**:
- Massive federal investment in Hawaii economy
- $111M/month = $1.3B annually at peak
- Multiplier effect: ~$165M-200M economic activity
- Supports Hawaii retailers, farmers, food supply chain
