## Analysis 1: Post-Pandemic Recovery (2019-2025)

### Methodology
Analyzed monthly participation and benefit data across four periods:
1. **Pre-Pandemic** (Jan 2019 - Feb 2020): Baseline
2. **Pandemic Emergency** (Mar 2020 - Aug 2021): Crisis response
3. **Benefit Phase-out** (Sep 2021 - Dec 2022): Emergency allotments wind-down
4. **Post-Emergency** (Jan 2023 - May 2025): New normal

### Participation Trends

## Analysis 2: Retailer Network Evolution (2020-2024)

### Methodology
Analyzed SNAP retailer authorization and deauthorization data for 2020-2024 period, examining:
- New authorizations by year
- Store type distribution
- Geographic patterns
- Net change in food access infrastructure

### Network Growth Summary

**2020-2024 Period**:
- **370** new retailer authorizations
- **364** deauthorizations (closures)
- **+6** net change (0.7% growth)
- Average **74 authorizations per year**

### Annual Authorization Trends

| Year | New Authorizations | Deauthorizations | Net Change |
|------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| 2020 | 75 | 55 | +20 |
| 2021 | 67 | 78 | -11 |
| 2022 | 74 | 82 | -8 |
| 2023 | 74 | 71 | +3 |
| 2024 | 80 | 78 | +2 |
| **Total** | **370** | **364** | **+6** |

**Observation**: High turnover (nearly equal authorizations/closures) suggests dynamic but relatively stable network size.

### Store Type Analysis

**New Authorizations (2020-2024)**:
1. Convenience Store: 180 (48.6%)
2. Small Grocery Store: 38 (10.3%)
3. Combination Grocery/Other: 29 (7.8%)
4. Medium Grocery Store: 29 (7.8%)
5. Farmers' Market: 19 (5.1%)

**Currently Active Network (896 total)**:
1. Convenience Store: 381 (42.5%)
2. Super Store: 122 (13.6%)
3. Combination Grocery/Other: 112 (12.5%)
4. Medium Grocery Store: 60 (6.7%)
5. Small Grocery Store: 55 (6.1%)

**Key Insight**: Nearly half of new authorizations are convenience stores, raising questions about healthy food access.

### Geographic Distribution

**New Authorizations by County (2020-2024)**:
- **Honolulu**: 208 (56.2%) - Highest activity
- **Hawaii**: 73 (19.7%)
- **Maui**: 57 (15.4%)
- **Kauai**: 32 (8.6%) - Lowest activity

**Currently Active by County**:
- **Honolulu**: 540 (60.3%)
- **Hawaii**: 168 (18.8%)
- **Maui**: 124 (13.8%)
- **Kauai**: 64 (7.1%)

**Observation**: Geographic distribution of new retailers roughly matches population distribution and existing network.

### Store Type Evolution

**Pre-2020 Authorizations (still active): 623**
- Convenience Store: 40.8%
- Super Store: 17.3%
- Combination Grocery/Other: 15.4%

**2020-2024 Authorizations (still active): 273**
- Convenience Store: 46.5% ↑
- Small Grocery Store: 11.0% (new prominence)
- Medium Grocery Store: 8.4%
- **Farmers' Markets: 6.2%** (notable increase)

**Key Finding**: Shift toward smaller stores and increase in farmers' market authorizations suggests growing interest in local food systems.

### Pandemic Impact on Food Infrastructure

1. **Sustained Growth**: Network continued expanding throughout pandemic (avg 74/year)
2. **High Turnover**: 364 closures offset most growth
3. **Convenience Store Dominance**: 48.6% of new stores are convenience stores
4. **Farmers' Market Growth**: 19 new farmers' market authorizations (5.1% of new retailers)
5. **Geographic Stability**: New retailers distributed similarly to existing network

## Key Insights Across Analyses

### 1. Participation Recovery Pattern

The complete 2022-2025 data reveals that Hawaii SNAP participation:
- Did not return to pre-pandemic baseline
- Stabilized at ~13% above pre-pandemic levels
- Suggests lasting economic impact from pandemic disruption
- May reflect increased awareness/reduced stigma from universal crisis experience

### 2. Benefit Adequacy Concerns

Despite declining from emergency peaks:
- Benefits remain 43% above pre-pandemic levels
- But Hawaii's high cost of living means even elevated benefits may be inadequate
- Gap between benefit levels and actual food costs warrants further analysis

### 3. Food Access Infrastructure

Retailer network findings suggest:
- Nearly stable network size despite high turnover
- Heavy reliance on convenience stores (48.6% of new authorizations)
- Limited growth in full-service grocery stores
- Positive: Increased farmers' market participation (5.1% of new retailers)

### 4. The "New Normal"

Data shows Hawaii SNAP program has reached a new equilibrium:
- Higher participation than pre-pandemic
- Lower than emergency peak
- Stabilized benefit levels
- Steady retailer network

---

## Policy Implications

### Immediate Considerations

1. **Benefit Adequacy**: With Hawaii's high cost of living, even elevated benefits may be insufficient. Analysis comparing benefits to local food costs recommended.

2. **Food Access Quality**: High proportion of convenience stores (vs grocery stores) raises concerns about access to healthy, affordable food options.

3. **Geographic Equity**: Lower retailer growth in rural counties (Kauai, neighbor islands) may indicate access disparities.

4. **Enrollment Gap**: With participation stabilized above pre-pandemic but below peak, examine barriers to eligible but un-enrolled populations.

### Recommended Further Analyses

Based on 2022 Report recommendations and current data:

**High Priority** (data available):
1. ✅ Post-pandemic recovery analysis (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ Retailer network evolution (COMPLETED)
3. **Benefit adequacy analysis** - Adjust for Hawaii CPI and compare to food costs
4. **Seasonal patterns** - Do participation/benefits vary by season?

**Medium Priority** (requires data requests):
1. **SNAP spending by retailer type** - Where are dollars actually spent?
2. **Household composition** - Demographics of SNAP participants
3. **Certification period analysis** - Why is Hawaii's shorter than national average?

**Advanced** (requires partnerships):
1. **Eligibility-enrollment gap** - Utilize Census visualization tool
2. **SNAP-Ed mapping tool** - Identify program service gaps
3. **Outcomes analysis** - Link SNAP to food security/health outcomes
