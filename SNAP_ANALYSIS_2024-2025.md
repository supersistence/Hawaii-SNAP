# Hawaii SNAP Program Analysis: 2024-2025
**Analysis Date:** October 23, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document provides analysis and context for Hawaii's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) covering the 2024-2025 period, incorporating the most recent available data and policy changes.

### Key Findings (FY 2024)

- **Participation:** ~161,600 individuals (11.2% of Hawaii's population)
- **Households:** ~56,690 households (11.5% of all Hawaii households)
- **Current Estimate (2025):** 84,869 households / 165,659 individuals
- **National Ranking:** 26th highest SNAP participation rate among states and DC

---

## Participation Trends

### FY 2024 Snapshot

Hawaii's SNAP participation in FY 2024 shows the program serving a significant portion of the state's population, particularly in rural areas.

#### By County (FY 2024)
- **Hawaii County:** 18% of households (highest in state)
- **Other Counties:** Data to be updated when county-level files available

#### Demographics
- Approximately **11.2% of Hawaii's total population** receives SNAP benefits
- **11.5% of all households** participate in the program
- Distribution varies significantly by county, with rural areas showing higher participation rates

### Historical Context (2022-2025 Trends)

The 3+ year period from early 2022 to 2025 represents a significant transition period for SNAP:

#### COVID-19 Emergency Benefits Phase-Out
- Emergency allotments ended in 2023
- Transition from pandemic-era elevated benefits to standard levels
- Expected to see decline in total benefits distributed even as base participation stabilizes

#### Post-Pandemic Economic Recovery
- Labor market recovery affecting eligibility
- Return to pre-pandemic work requirements
- Changing household economic situations

**Analysis Gap:** Current repository data ends January 2022, missing this entire transition period. Updated data (available through May 2025) would reveal:
- How quickly pandemic-era participation declined
- Whether participation stabilized at a new baseline
- Impact of benefit reductions on average household support

## Benefit Levels

### Maximum Allotments for Family of Four

| Fiscal Year | Effective Date | Maximum Allotment | Change from Previous |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| FY 2024 | Oct 1, 2023 | $1,759 | ↓ Decrease |
| FY 2025 | Oct 1, 2024 | $1,723 | ↓ $36 decrease |
| FY 2026 | Oct 1, 2025 | TBD | ↓ Expected decrease (~$8/person) |

### Recent Benefit Trends

**Notable Pattern:** Three consecutive years of **decreasing** maximum allotments
- This represents a significant shift from pandemic-era increases
- Average $8 per person decrease expected for FY 2026
- Reflects Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) calculations

### Impact Analysis

**For Hawaii families:**
- A family of four receiving maximum benefits saw **$36/month reduction** in FY 2025
- Annual impact: **$432/year** decrease for maximum-benefit households
- Cumulative effect compounds over multiple years

**Policy Context:**
- Hawaii has unique COLA calculations due to higher cost of living
- Even with higher allotments than mainland states, purchasing power varies by island
- Maximum allotments may not reflect actual average benefits received

---

## Policy Changes

### One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) - July 4, 2025

**Key Provisions Affecting SNAP:**
- Work requirement modifications for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs)
- Implementation date: **November 1, 2025**

**Expected Impacts:**
- Changes to ABAWD work requirements
- Potential effect on participation rates in late 2025
- State implementation challenges

### Work Requirements Evolution

**Timeline:**
- Pre-pandemic: Standard ABAWD work requirements
- 2020-2021: Waivers due to COVID-19
- 2022-2023: Gradual reinstatement
- 2025: OBBBA modifications

**Analysis Priority:** November 2025 data (when available) will be critical for measuring OBBBA impact.

## Retailer Network Analysis

### Current Understanding

**Last Available Data:** Through 2021
**Updated Data Available:** Through December 31, 2024 (not yet integrated)

### Known Issues with Retailer Data

**Geolocation Accuracy Problems:**
- Historical data showed ~39% of Hawaii records (1,614 out of 4,099) with invalid coordinates
- Coordinates outside Hawaii geographic bounds (18°-23°N, 154°-161°W)
- Affects mapping and spatial analysis

**Expected 2022-2024 Changes:**
- Post-pandemic retailer network evolution
- Small retailer closures vs. new authorizations
- Changes in store type distribution
- Island-specific retail patterns

### Retailer Type Distribution (Historical)

Based on previous data patterns, Hawaii's SNAP retailers typically include:
- Large grocery chains
- Convenience stores (high count, lower volume)
- Farmers markets (growing segment)
- Military commissaries
- Small independent grocers

**Update Priority:** 2024 retailer data will show:
- Impact of pandemic on small retailers
- Growth/decline by store type
- Geographic shifts in food access
- Authorization/deauthorization patterns

---

## Geographic Analysis

### County Participation Rates (FY 2024)

**Hawaii County: 18% of households**
- Highest participation rate in state
- Rural areas typically show higher SNAP participation
- Economic factors: tourism dependence, agricultural employment, cost of living

### Island-Specific Considerations

**Oahu:**
- Largest population base
- More diverse employment opportunities
- Higher cost of living may increase eligibility

**Hawaii Island (Big Island):**
- Highest participation rate
- Rural areas with limited job opportunities
- Agricultural employment (often seasonal/lower wage)

**Maui County:**
- Tourism-dependent economy
- Seasonal employment variations
- Housing cost pressures

**Kauai:**
- Smallest population
- Limited economic diversity
- Geographic isolation affects food access

### Data Gap Impact

**Missing County-Level Data (July 2020 - Present):**
Current repository has bi-annual county data only through July 2020 (note: README incorrectly states January 2021). This represents a **5+ year gap** in county-level analysis.

**Critical Questions Unanswered:**
- How did each county's participation change during pandemic?
- Which islands saw fastest recovery/decline?
- Did county participation rates converge or diverge?
- Impact of island-specific economic conditions?

## Conclusion

Hawaii's SNAP program serves a vital role supporting over 165,000 individuals across the state. The 2024-2025 period represents a significant transition from pandemic-era operations to a new normal characterized by:

1. **Declining benefit levels** (three consecutive years)
2. **Policy changes** (OBBBA work requirements)
3. **Post-pandemic economic evolution**
4. **Persistent cost-of-living pressures**

**Critical Data Gap:** This analysis is constrained by the 3-5 year gap in the repository's datasets. The period from 2022-2025 captures transformative changes in the program that remain unquantified.

**Immediate Action Needed:**
- Download and integrate updated datasets (procedures provided)
- Validate data quality
- Update visualizations
- Conduct quantitative analysis of trends identified here

**Value of Complete Data:** Once updated, this repository will provide comprehensive documentation of Hawaii's SNAP program evolution through a unique period of pandemic response, emergency benefit wind-down, benefit reductions, and policy reforms.
