## Expected File Details

### Monthly SNAP Data

- `SNAPsummary.xls` or `SNAPsummary.xlsx`
- `state-monthly-data-fy69-fy25.zip` or similar

**After extraction/filtering, should contain:**
- Hawaii records only
- Date range: October 1989 - May 2025
- Approximately 428 monthly records
- Columns: Date, Households, Persons, Per Household, Per Person, Cost

### Retailer Historical Data

**Downloaded file likely named:**

- `store_locations.csv.zip` or similar
- `SNAP_Retailer_Historical_Data.zip` or similar

## Hawaii SNAP Context (for reference)

### Current Participation (FY 2024):
- **Households:** 56,690 (11.5% of state)
- **Individuals:** 161,600 (11.2% of population)

### Recent Changes:
- **FY 2025:** Max benefit for family of 4 = $1,723/month
- **July 4, 2025:** One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) signed

- Impact of OBBBA legislation
- New work requirement effects
- Retailer network changes during and after pandemic
